This dashboard demonstrates the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** using a real-world example relevant to content creators: **daily ad revenue**.

Daily ad revenue can be unpredictable. Some days might have unusually high earnings due to a viral post, while most days are average. This results in a **skewed distribution**. The CLT tells us that if we take the *average* revenue over a sample of many days (e.g., 30 days) and repeat this process many times, the distribution of these averages will look like a **normal distribution (a bell curve)**.

    This simulation shows why the Central Limit Theorem is so important for Raptive.

    1.  **Predictability from Unpredictability:** Even though individual daily earnings for a creator are volatile and skewed (as seen in the left chart), the average earnings over a period (like a month) become very predictable and stable (as seen in the right chart).

    2.  **Accurate Forecasting:** Because the distribution of these averages is normal, we can use its statistical properties to create accurate earnings forecasts and confidence intervals. For example, we can say with high confidence that a creator's average monthly revenue will fall within a certain range.

    3.  **Risk Management:** Understanding this principle helps manage risk. We know that a single bad day won't sink long-term earnings, as it will be balanced out over the sampling period.

    By increasing the **'Days in each sample (N)'** slider, you'll see the bell curve on the right become even narrower and more defined, signifying that longer-term averages are even more stable and predictable.
